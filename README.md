## MultiHopQA with DSPy, ColBERT, and Qwen 2.5 72B

This project demonstrates how to perform **MultiHop Question Answering (QA)**, a task that requires synthesizing information from multiple sources to answer complex questions. The solution integrates several state-of-the-art tools like **DSPy**, **ColBERT**, **HotPotQA**, **TuneAPI**, and **Qwen 2.5 72B**.



### Future Plans
- Additional tutorials on text generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and more will be added as part of this repository.
