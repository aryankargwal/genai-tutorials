## MultiHopQA with DSPy, ColBERT, and Qwen 2.5 72B

This project demonstrates how to perform **MultiHop Question Answering (QA)**, a task that requires synthesizing information from multiple sources to answer complex questions. The solution integrates several state-of-the-art tools like **DSPy**, **ColBERT**, **HotPotQA**, **TuneAPI**, and **Qwen 2.5 72B**.

### Future Plans
- Additional tutorials on text generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and more will be added as part of this repository.

## VLM Stress Testing with Llama 3.2, Qwen 2 VL, and GPT 4o

This project provides a framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by comparing their performance on multi-modal question-answering tasks. It allows users to upload images, input questions, and test responses across multiple state-of-the-art models like Llama 3.2, Qwen 2 VL, and GPT 4o. The application tracks key metrics like response quality, latency, and token usage to determine the best-performing model for each task.

### Future Plans
Upcoming enhancements include expanded model comparisons, fine-tuning tutorials, and automated dataset generation for advanced multi-modal tasks.

## AI Assistant-Led Marketing Campaign Generator

In this tutorial, we build a multi-turn assistant application using **Tune Studio** to automate various marketing-related tasks. The app performs **market research**, analyzes **numerical data**, and generates **campaign strategies** and **sample posters** using AI assistants powered by models like **Claude Sonnet** and **GPT4o**. This tutorial covers how AI assistants can collaborate to streamline workflows, such as content creation, strategy planning, and image generation.

### Future Plans
- Further enhancements, including advanced assistant workflows for more complex marketing and automation tasks.

## Janus 1.3B Multimodal AI

This tutorial guides you through deploying **Janus 1.3B**, a compact yet powerful vision-language model. You will learn how to leverage Janus for both text understanding and image generation with a straightforward implementation. The tutorial covers the architecture of Janus, including its tokenization methods, multimodal processing, and practical usage examples.

### Future Plans
- Additional insights on tuning and optimizing Janus for specific use cases and performance benchmarks.

## Omniparser for Document Parsing

The **Omniparser** tutorial focuses on handling complex document parsing tasks, extracting and structuring data for NLP workflows. This project is ideal for anyone needing to process diverse document types, as it covers setup, parsing strategies, and methods to ensure clean, organized data for downstream applications.

### Future Plans
- Expansion to cover additional data extraction methods and integration with text and image processing modules.

## Qwen 2.5 Coder - UI to Code Transformation

The **Qwen 2.5 Coder** tutorial demonstrates the use of **Qwen 2.5** to transform UI layouts into HTML/CSS code. It offers a streamlined solution for automating design-to-code workflows, enabling rapid prototyping and design implementation.

### Future Plans
- Additional examples with more complex UI layouts and improvements in customization for UI component parsing.
