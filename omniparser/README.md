This repository features an **advanced multimodal parsing application** using **[OmniParser by Microsoft](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19128)**, a robust vision-language model (VLM) developed to interpret complex visual and text elements in documents and screen layouts. OmniParser offers precise, context-aware parsing, making it ideal for applications in automated workflows and agent pipelines.

## Overview

[OmniParser](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19128) is a sophisticated model for extracting data from documents, screens, and layouts that integrate both text and visuals. Its specialized architecture allows it to recognize both **what** an element is and **where** it is located, significantly enhancing tasks like form automation and screen parsing. OmniParser handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, adapting easily to diverse formats.

This repo includes:
- **Streamlit applications** for **image parsing** and **screen layout analysis**.
- Simple setup scripts to enable you to deploy OmniParser with minimal configuration.

### Tools & Frameworks:
- **OmniParser**: Vision-Language Model specialized for parsing multimodal layouts.
- **Streamlit**: Web app framework to demonstrate OmniParser’s parsing and visual layout capabilities.

## Steps to Run

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryankargwal/genai-tutorials
cd omniparser
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Use the command below to install the necessary requirements:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Download Weights
Then download the model ckpts files in: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/OmniParser, and put them under weights/, default folder structure is: weights/icon_detect, weights/icon_caption_florence, weights/icon_caption_blip2.

### 4. Run the Streamlit Applications

For **document parsing and layout analysis**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
```

## Features

- **Multimodal Parsing**: OmniParser interprets text, tables, forms, and other layout components with high accuracy.
- **Screen Layout Analysis**: Extracts and visualizes text and element positions, ideal for automating software interaction and support workflows.
- **Efficient and Scalable**: Optimized for real-time performance, providing rapid insights even with complex layouts.

## Future Work
- **Enhanced Fine-tuning**: Additional tutorials for fine-tuning OmniParser on specialized datasets.
- **Expanded Use Cases**: Further explorations into applications for customer service, virtual assistance, and automated form-filling.
